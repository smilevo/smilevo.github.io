I am an aspiring graduate software engineering student, currently working at Amazon as an SDE intern. I plan to perform a detailed study in the area of software quality assurance and supplement my studies with additional resources to transform the evidence and sources I have learnt into a real-world application (that is, a tool). I am highly motivated to perform and conduct studies that would be helpful to the community of software engineers and would also provide me with knowledge for the same. I believe in meticulous examination and am highly motivated to never narrow my working/studying hours. While mentioning all my interests and aspects of my career, I make sure to consume knowledge before relevantly listing those in my resume.
