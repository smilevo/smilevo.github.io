Hi, my name is Neha Vanjara and I am a graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing masters in Data Science. I have done my undergrad in Computer Engineering, and I will be graduating in May 2024. I have interned with AMD for about 8 months where I worked for Product Yield Engineering Team. I enjoy working in a fast-paced environment and always up for learning and working with new technologies and I am comfortable working with tools like JmpPro, Python, MySQL, RStudio, Minitab, Snowflake.
In my spare time, I like to go on hikes or practice singing.
