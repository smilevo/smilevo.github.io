abstract: 'The rapid growth of the mobile applications development industry raises several new challenges to developers as they need to respond quickly to the users’ needs in a world of
  continuous changes. Indeed, mobile apps undergo frequent updates to introduce new features, fix reported issues or adapt to new technological or environment changes. Hence,
  introducing changes in this context is risky and can harmfully impact the application rating and competitiveness. Thus, ensuring that the application updates are deployed in a controlled way is of crucial importance.
  To better support mobile applications evolution and cut-off the costs of users dissatisfaction, we propose in this paper, APPTRACKER, a novel
  approach to automatically track bad release updates in Android applications (i.e., releases with higher percentage of negative reviews relative to the prior releases). We formulate the
  problem as a three-class classification problem to label the apps updates as bad, neutral or good. To solve this problem, we evolve bad release detection rules using Multi-Objective
  Genetic Programming (MOGP) based on the adaptation of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). In particular, the search process aims to provide the optimal
  trade-off between two conflicting objectives to deal with the considered classes. We evaluate our approach and investigate the performance of both within-project and cross-project
  validation scenarios on a benchmark of 50,700 updates from 1,717 free Android apps from Google Play Store. The statistical tests revealed that our approach achieves a clear advantage
  over machine learning approaches (e.g., random forest, decision tree, etc.) with significant improvements of 18% and 6% in terms of F1-score within-project and cross-project
  validations, respectively. Furthermore, the features analysis reveals that (1) the previous updates ratings and (2) the APK size are the most important features for both within and cross-project scenarios'
